> Arena is a demo server made with [Minestom](https://github.com/Minestom/Minestom), as both a showcase for what Minestom is 
capable of and as a way to teach developers how to work with Minestom.
 
> This is a BridgeSplash fork of the original Arena project, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Minestom/Arena).

# Install
Arena can be installed in multiple ways. You can use a pre-built version or clone and build it yourself.
We recommend cloning since this allows you to experiment with Minestom.

## Cloning
You can also choose to clone this repository with:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/BridgeSplash/Arena.git
```
And then build with:
```shell
./gradlew build
```
You will then find your jar in ./build/libs/ which you can run with:
```shell
java -jar arena-{version}.jar
```
Of course, you can also use an IDE which makes this process easier.

# Goals
Minestom - The reason behind making Arena was to help new developers get into Minestom and familiarize themselves with the toolchain.
Besides, it's a good showcase of what Minestom can do.
BridgeSplash - The reason behind making this fork was to extend the original Arena project to support the BridgeSplash server.
